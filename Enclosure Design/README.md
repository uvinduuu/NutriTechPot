# NutriTech Pot Enclosure

Welcome to the NutriTech Pot Enclosure repository! This repository contains the design files for the enclosure of the NutriTech Pot, a smart plant pot with an automatic watering system. Currently, we have designed and printed the PCB housing box, which will be the first step towards the full product.

- **Power Indicator**: Includes an LED to indicate the power status.

## Dimensions

- **Box Size**: 120 mm x 70 mm

## Usage

1. **Print the Box**: Use the provided SolidWorks files to 3D print the enclosure.
2. **Mount the PCB**: Fix the PCB inside the box using M3 screws.
3. **Install the Battery**: Place a 9V battery in the designated compartment.
4. **Connect the Rocker Switch and LED**: Wire the rocker switch and LED as indicated to control and show the power status.

## Future Plans

Originally designed with an inbuilt water tank, the NutriTech Pot will eventually include a complete system for automatic watering. This initial enclosure is just for the PCB and power components.
